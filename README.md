# PyPlayer
Just plays shows and movies innit

## Intructions:
1. Run the windows executable or the linux binary 
2. cloning the git repo and running the python file directly is recommended in the case of linux users due to a bug in the packaging tool I use
3. Follow the instructions on screen
4. Watch movie
